# SSM Ingest scripts

A set of scripts that manage the collection of data from FTP/SFTP servers.

> NB. These scripts were inherited from the previous environment and we expect to redevelop these to meet better technical service standards and run as Docker containers.

## Main data colletion scripts

These are documented in the [.db helper scripts README](ADT/README-ftp_scripts.md) file.

## Helper scripts

These are documented in the [.db helper scripts README](ADT/README-.db-helper_scripts.md) file.

## Other utility scripts

These still need to be documented.
